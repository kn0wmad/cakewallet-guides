Wownero is a Doge-inspired, CPU-mineable, solo-mining only, privacy-respecting memecoin. It is a software fork of Monero, but with a lite version of RandomX, larger ring size, and a fixed supply of 184 million coins emitted over 50 years.

## Usage

Because Wownero is a fork of Monero, it mostly works the same way from a user perspective, and most of the information on the [Monero](https://docs.cakewallet.com/cryptos/monero/) page will apply to Wownero.

The major differences from Monero is that multiple accounts are not supported.

## Seed Format

Cake Wallet uses a the 16-word Polyseed (Default) or the 25-word legacy seed for wallet creation. We also support restoring using the 14-word seed.
